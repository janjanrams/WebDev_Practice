        <p>Hello yuki! It's been a week since you left the Philippines. I am really grateful that we <br>
            were able to be great friends. Although we barely had classes together we still <br>
            continued beinb friends HAHAHA. <br><br>
            
            I remember first time talking to you, it was during discrete structures 1 and you were <br>
            asking about the UE Portal from me. I only heard you mostly from gossips from Micko <br>
            and the othersüòÇüòÇ. Your looks became a hot topic for manyüòÇ, even the elevator girl <br>
            joins in on the gossips about you. Haishh you are really handsome Yuki for even the <br>
            staff members to join inüòè. First, I felt shy towards around you since you know, you <br>
            being a foreigner HAHAHA. I got to practice a lot of english from you.<br><br>
            
            Yuki, do you believed in magic? Did you believe in it during your younger years? <br>
            HAHAHA it's so hard to make you laugh at magic related jokes that I wanted to make <br>
            you believe in it. You always attack me with logicüòë it feels like you lost a lot of <br>
            childhood not pretending to be a fate reader HAHAHA. If you keep up on your logical <br>
            arguments with magic, I think you'll be single for quite a while HAHAHA. Well, are <br>
            you single? If not, congratulations HAHAHA.<br><br>
            
            To prepare things, I made a little magic trick to youüòâ you should play it at least 5 times HAHAHA<br><br>
            
            Yuki is this Cat smiling or not? It felt like I was against the world defending my view <br>
            from anyone. My motto was to see the brighter side of life. Maybe that's why for <br>
            me this cat was smiling HAHAHA.<br><br>
            
            I am very thankful that you help me in programming. Well, it's not the only thing <br>
            you helped me with. You know, I never really put any effort in learning programming. I'm <br>
            just doing enough to pass the course in our curriculum. But after meeting you, seeing <br>
            how different you were from us, it felt that staying as I was is not enough. That's why I <br>
            started trying to learn more things and make an effort in learning programming. <br><br>
            
            I know that we tend to always talk about academic stuffs but I was really happy <br>
            about it. I think you were the only one I can talk to you that way and understand me to some degree. <br><br>
            
            I'm curious to know if how good I am in your terms when it comes to programming. I <br>
            think you probably know by now what my level is. You don't have to sugarcoat <br>
            anything and be honest! Even though I keep saying that, you might hold back HAHAHA.<br><br>
            
            I finally finished this mini project I did HAHAHA. Although I gave up some of the <br>
            parts I still wanted to add but thesis hindering me from doing this. Heck my <br>
            classes runs until 7:30 pm or 8pmüò≠ good life no more<br><br>
            
            But nevertheless, I still wanted to finish this because I wanted to give this to you. WELL <br>THAT IS ALL HAHAHA. <br><br>
            
            It was fun meeting you and spending time with you. I will miss you and see you next <br>
            time! My second year wasn't so bad after all since I met you! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br></p>
